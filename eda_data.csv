Extract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data
Develop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner

Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software
What Were Looking For

A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.
3+ years of engineering experience
Things move quickly in the data group. Youll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.
Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar
This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.
Professional experience with Python data tools
Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.
Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies
We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.
Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!
Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.
Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.
Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.
Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.
Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.
Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.
Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazons EMR would also be an asset.
Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.
GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.
JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.
About IZEA:

We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention.

Centric Consulting is not the typical consulting company. We live our core values and bring them with us in all we do for our clients and community. Our core purpose is simple: every day we strive to provide unmatched customer and employee experiences and foster a culture of respect, diversity, and transparency. It’s this culture, our people, and delivery that come together to make Centric a trusted advisor to local businesses.

Our St. Louis business unit has a team of seasoned consultants that possess deep industry skills and bring an experienced approach to strategy with an eye on the processes and technology that enable organizations to achieve objectives. We’re looking for a .Net Developer to join our growing team.

In this role, you will:
You will craft and develop .NET based applications, translating business requirements and use cases into functional applications.

You will contribute in all phases of the development lifecycle, ensuring the best possible performance, quality, and responsiveness of the applications.

Create unmatched experiences, for both clients and employees, is what we do. You should revel in doing the unexpected and extraordinary for others.

A learning mindset, ready to experience new ideas and situations regularly.
Consulting experience is strongly preferred. That said, you will also be considered if you have a strong industry background. We like to work in the communities we live in.

And because we work with clients, excellent communication skills are important – both written and verbal. Translating technical concepts into layman’s terms is an essential skill.
Initiative is important. We don’t hand hold – you should be comfortable working independently in an entrepreneurial environment. That said, collaboration is equally important. Our St. Louis team and other technologists at Centric will give you an amazing support system. You will lean on them daily.
Last but not least, you will, of course, need to be an experienced .NET or .NET Core Developer. We are looking for people with demonstrated capabilities with .NET. The more experience you have with technologies like .NET Framework (4.x.x, Core), MVC Framework, creating Fluent-RESTful APIs, O/RM (Entity Framework, NHibernate, etc…), Modern Web Experience (Angular, Bootstrap, Node), DevOps tooling and Container technology, the better.
What makes Centric different?
Special Culture – Our people make us different. We have highly talented, intelligent individuals across a broad variety of disciplines – who are eager to learn from you and share their own expertise. We embrace fresh perspectives and each other. Don’t take our word for it – check us out on Glassdoor , Facebook , Twitter or Instagram to get a glimpse inside what makes us different.
Growth opportunities – As a mid-size firm, there is more flexibility when it comes to career paths. Figure out what you want to do and we'll help you figure out how to get there.
Impact – We think of ourselves as a big company with a small company feel – a local player with global reach that combines business, technology and industry expertise.
Unmatched Experiences – We are allowed to be ourselves here. We are encouraged to be human. It’s at the root of who we are as a firm and why we’re here .
Innovation – We value passion, determination, perseverance, and innovation . We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going.
Passion for the greater good – We are steadfast in our devotion to the communities we serve and in actively promoting employee involvement in community improvement projects .

42,Software Developer - .Net/VSTO/SQL,$85K-$151K (Glassdoor Est.),"eAlchemy is looking for a smart, curious, and motivated .Net/VSTO/SQL developer to help our clients raise their productivity to new heights. Projects with our clients vary quite a bit, but they nearly always involve a wide array of data sources and types. We typically use a front-end/back-end architecture where the UI is often Excel and, increasingly, web based reports and dashboards. Projects are typically small to medium, generally lasting from a week to three months.

Our service mentality sets us apart with our clients, and to be a successful member of our team you have to enjoy helping people. Our ideal candidate loves the challenge of software development, but not as its own end- they're interested in the business challenges as much as the code because that's where the real value is created. The best candidates will have great skills and experiences and be comfortable sharing these with their peers.

We're based in Petaluma, CA, and our development team generally works from home 3 days/wk (currently in the office Monday and Wednesday). Please make sure you're willing to make that commitment prior to applying. For outstanding non-local candidates, a relocation stipend can be provided, but requires relocation within 20 miles of our Petaluma office.

Finally, we're not looking to work with other tech services companies, so please don't solicit our business.

Please don't email us. Instead, apply below.

Desired Personal Characteristics
Smart and Curious- You're very smart, but more importantly, you're driven to understand how things work. You listen well because you want to understand the person and the problem better.
Accountable- You always feel personally responsible for the the success of everything you're affiliated with- quality, timelines, and budgets. You own the success and failures because you're passionate about success today and into the future.
Constructive- You're focused on positive outcomes for the team above all else. Ego takes a back seat. You project a positive energy and demonstrate awareness and concern for how you and the work you put forward is perceived.
Resilient & Flexible- You're very comfortable in an ever-changing and ambiguous world, comfortable admitting when you don't have the answer. Conversely, you should be savvy enough to know when failure is an acceptable outcome of measured risks.
Service-minded- You have an innate desire to help others. You want everyone around you to be better, work better and enjoy more.
Innovative- Innovation is driven by perceptiveness and creativity. Your curiosity, attention, and ability to cull masses of information enable you to see things that others don't- patterns, anomalies, and pitfalls. And, in really understanding the challenge at hand, you're able to apply creative solutions that address the real issue.

Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.

Overview

Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.

Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).

Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.

Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves -- and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.

Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.
Production experience training and serving traffic using ML models.
Experience designing large scale systems and implementing core components.
Fluency in one of {C++, Go, Java}, with interest in developing proficiency in all three.

At Patientco, we are building the future of healthcare payments. Our technology is helping create a better payment experience for patients and in turn, providing incredible value to healthcare providers across the U.S. Whether you are customer facing or working diligently behind the scenes, everyone at Patientco plays a vital role in improving the healthcare experience of millions of people. It’s a big job, but we wouldn’t have it any other way!

As a Software Engineer at Patientco, you should care deeply about how your software is experienced. This means considering how both healthcare patients and providers use your products and how your peers will interact with your code.

Your experience should include having built and - equally important - maintained widely-used software. You should have a knack for making tools powerful without compromising their ease of use.

You should enjoy variety (and we aren't just referring to the food and drinks we keep stocked in our kitchen), as you should expect to move up and down the software stack. You will be writing the code that powers our payments engine, digging deep into the back-end to write and tune SQL and dabbling in the client-side JavaScript, HTML and CSS of our web app.

Our Application
Patientco is a web-based healthcare payments platform built primarily with object-oriented PHP, Golang and JavaScript (including multiple frameworks) - our team members have backgrounds in PHP, Java, .Net and Ruby.
We move quickly, deploying code many times a week, but we also spend time carefully thinking through the edge cases of our products.
What We're Looking For:
Experience building and maintaining products with real-world usage
Extensive familiarity with object-oriented software systems based in PHP, Java, .Net or Ruby (we care less about what languages you know and more about your ability to grasp concepts)
Great Communication Skills! Have opinions about good and bad products and the ability to justify them, we want to know what you think!
Advocates of the agile/lean software development process
A degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or have equivalent experience
The desire to build a great culture. Namely, be ethical, collaborative, hard-working, creative, FUN, and willing to push your boss out of the raft

How we take care of the people who work here:

• An open and casual office environment (currently fully remote until further notice) that values excellent communication and collaboration skills, creative problem solving, empathy, open mindedness, extreme attention to detail, a healthy dose of grit and a good sense of humor.
