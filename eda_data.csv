Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.

Overview

Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.

Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).

Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.

Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves -- and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.

Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.
Production experience training and serving traffic using ML models.
Experience designing large scale systems and implementing core components.

Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.

Overview

Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.

Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).

Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.

Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves -- and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.

Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.
Production experience training and serving traffic using ML models.
Experience designing large scale systems and implementing core components.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable backend services
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot, Grails, Vert.x and Ratpack
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit and Cucumber
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala and Clojure
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Oracle and Postgres
NoSQL technologies such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Cassandra
Messaging technologies such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, ActiveMQ, and Amazon SQS
Build tools such as Gradle, Maven and sbt
Cloud based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean, OpenStack, and Rackspace
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.8,"Object Partners

database administrators will engage in activities to restore services that are
down or degraded. This may be as simple as running an existing script to
restart a service or executing a standard operating procedure or may require
code changes with review steps, integration, testing, and software deployments
to restore service to normal operation. Besides, engagement with other
Oracle development and support teams may be needed.

Oracle Database Security Development Group is the core security group in Oracle. The team developed a variety of core security products in Oracle Database Kernel.

Oracle Databases hold the majority of the world’s relational data, and are attractive targets for attackers seeking high-value targets for data theft. Compromise of a single Oracle Database can result in tens of millions of breached records costing millions in breach-mitigation activity. Safeguard your most valuable data with Oracle’s powerful preventive and detective security controls, including transparent data encryption, encryption key management, privileged user and multi-factor access control, data classification and discovery, database activity monitoring and blocking, consolidated auditing and reporting, and data masking. With Oracle, you can deploy reliable data-security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.

Oracle Advanced Security provides two important preventive controls to protect sensitive data at the source: encryption and redaction. Together, these two controls form the foundation of Oracle's defense-in-depth, multi-layered database security solution.

Transparent Data Ecryption (TDE) stops would-be attackers from bypassing the database and reading sensitive information directly from storage by enforcing data-at-rest encryption in the database layer.

Data Redaction complements TDE by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure in applications, redacting sensitive data before it leaves the database.

Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including SSL with digital certificates.

Oracle Advanced Security team works on all layers of the database kernel stack and provide advanced security products for customers.

Job Description

You will be a key contributor in designing and implementing major pieces of the core database infrastructure for security.

You will design major core data-security products that work with replication, data high availability, and disaster recovery, Implement database techniques and features to support service scalability, performance and stability. You will design core security products related to data access control, database privileges control, data encryption, encryption key management, network encryption, database authentication, and data redaction.

Preferred Qualifications


Oracle Database Security Development Group is the core security group in Oracle. The team developed a variety of core security products in Oracle Database Kernel.

Oracle Databases hold the majority of the world’s relational data, and are attractive targets for attackers seeking high-value targets for data theft. Compromise of a single Oracle Database can result in tens of millions of breached records costing millions in breach-mitigation activity. Safeguard your most valuable data with Oracle’s powerful preventive and detective security controls, including transparent data encryption, encryption key management, privileged user and multi-factor access control, data classification and discovery, database activity monitoring and blocking, consolidated auditing and reporting, and data masking. With Oracle, you can deploy reliable data-security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.

Oracle Advanced Security provides two important preventive controls to protect sensitive data at the source: encryption and redaction. Together, these two controls form the foundation of Oracle's defense-in-depth, multi-layered database security solution.

Transparent Data Ecryption (TDE) stops would-be attackers from bypassing the database and reading sensitive information directly from storage by enforcing data-at-rest encryption in the database layer.

Data Redaction complements TDE by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure in applications, redacting sensitive data before it leaves the database.

Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including SSL with digital certificates.

Oracle Advanced Security team works on all layers of the database kernel stack and provide advanced security products for customers.

Job Description

You will be a key contributor in designing and implementing major pieces of the core database infrastructure for security.

You will design major core data-security products that work with replication, data high availability, and disaster recovery, Implement database techniques and features to support service scalability, performance and stability.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers 165+ services to enable millions of active customers across 160 Points of Presence (65 cities in 29 countries) to run virtually any cloud workload. AWS services span compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management.

AWS Commerce Platform
The AWS Commerce Platform builds the software components upon which all other AWS teams build their services and run their businesses. We make it possible for AWS services to make their solutions available to customers with custom-made pricing and billing models, as well as providing functionality that allows service teams to securely accept payment for customers service usage. We further provide AWS customers of all shapes and sizes with the ability to analyze, control, and optimize their costs via the AWS Cost Management product suite.

We believe in building simple, reliable, and low-cost systems that scale to serve our customers needs via a set of customizable web service components built on a microservice architecture. We run our projects in small, autonomous teams, which opens up opportunities for our engineers to own projects all the way from design to delivery. In 2018 alone, we launched 60+ customer-facing features, demonstrating our continued commitment to rapidly deliver high-value features to our customers (both internal and external to AWS).

The AWS Commerce Platform is seeking talented problem solvers who are excited by the idea of building products that are used by developers, IT personnel, financial analysts, and business owners all over the world. At a high level, these are our tenets:

· Secure: We work diligently protect the confidentiality and integrity of billing, usage, cost, and other financial information.
· Reliable: We own the end-to-end billing and payments pipeline, and are committed to ensuring accuracy, timeliness, and visibility to our customers.
· Self-Service: We work to empower customers (both internal and external to AWS) with powerful, easy-to-use tools to help manage their products, access relevant information regarding their billing and payments, and manage their cloud costs.
· Flexible: The possibilities when operating on top of AWS are endless. We strive to support the needs of the broad base of AWS customers, while also providing the opportunity for customers with complex use cases to extend our platform to suit their business needs.
· Globalized: AWS operates internationally, so we have worked hard to ensure that our systems are globalized and can easily be localized for any market.
· Compliant: We continuously ensure that our systems meet all necessary regulatory compliance rules.


The AWS Commerce Platform team is organized into the following teams: AWS Metering & Bill Generation, AWS Insights, AWS Financial Experience, and AWS Fraud Prevention. You can learn more about each teams scope of responsibility and mission below.

AWS Metering & Bill Generation
The AWS Metering pipeline streams and processes all customer usage incurred on the AWS platform from around the globe. From there, the computation engine applies multidimensional input rules (such as purchase options and pricing dimensions) on trillions of usage events to compute and generate billions of real-time billing records with the ultimate goal of producing customers bills. In addition, each AWS service must onboard onto the AWS Metering & Bill Generation platform prior to launch in order to define and sell their products. This process includes defining custom logic for computing and allocating charge amounts so that it can be reflected in customer bills, and maintaining a single source of truth with respect to AWS billing.

Our mission is to develop a high-performance, robust on-demand bill generation platform that scales horizontally and offers flexible pricing methods, enabling AWS service teams to define and sell their products at scale.

AWS Insights
The AWS Insights team provides customers with granular insight into their cost and usage information via a suite of easy-to-use products, which include AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and the AWS Cost & Usage Reports. Using these products, customers can analyze their costs and usage over time, set budgets that alert them when they exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their user-defined thresholds, and access system-generated recommendations regarding opportunities for cost optimization. These products sit directly on top of the AWS Metering pipeline and empower customers of all shapes and sizes to better manage their costs and usage.

Our mission is to equip customers of all shapes and sizes with powerful products that enable them to access, organize, understand, optimize, and control their AWS costs and usage.

AWS Financial Experience
The AWS Financial Experience team owns the entire lifecycle of payment processing (including invoicing), collections, dunning, reconciliation, and refund services in order to provide a seamless payments and financial experience across AWSs customer base. As AWS operates internationally, we strive to support the full spectrum of international payment methods, monetary values, transaction volumes, and other use cases.

Our mission is to provide customers around the world with secure, reliable, and convenient ways to pay for their usage of AWS.

AWS Fraud Prevention
There will always be a few individuals who try to take unfair advantage of AWS and its customers, and the AWS Fraud Prevention team works tirelessly to outsmart them. We leverage the latest innovations in data mining, predictive modeling, machine learning, and web antifraud technical techniques (e.g., random forest algorithms) to ensure the safety of our customers and the AWS ecosystem.

Our mission is to leverage the latest technology, such as machine learning software, to detect and prevent fraudulent use of AWS resources.

Zoro.com is an eCommerce company that sells business supplies, equipment, and tools—but we’re much more than just a website. We’re a team of people who win and lose together (we prefer winning!). Since 2011, Zoro has been working hard to make it easy for our customers to purchase everything they need to make their businesses go. Zoro currently offers over 4 million products, fast and free shipping, no-hassle returns, and exceptional customer service. We’ve grown quickly in a short time, recently surpassing 400 team members and reaching annual revenue of over $500 million. Add to that our award-winning culture—we were named a Great Place to Work for 2019-20, among other accolades—and we think Zoro is a pretty amazing place to work and grow.

Position Description:

We now want to scale our secret recipe which is why we need talented folks like you to help us provide a world-class customer experience by developing and delivering game-changing digital solutions.

Zoro engineering is embarking on an exciting journey to build core engineering competencies that will enable us to make 100s of targeted releases daily, delighting our customers and giving them the best experience possible. Our engineering team is composed of a talented group of front-end, back-end, and full-stack engineers. We’re looking for an experienced Senior JavaScript Engineer to join our team of gifted developers and begin your journey of unleashing your true potential.

Constant improvements to zoro.com are delivered by our product teams. You will be on a high performing scrum team with approximately 4-6 software engineers as well as a dedicated tech lead, product owner, and architect. Ideally we are looking for engineers who are well rounded in building scalable applications but that doesn’t mean we won’t provide an environment that’ll help you grow.

Your objective will be to build and support robust tools, applications, and frameworks that provide a world class customer experience. As a JavaScript engineer, your work will directly impact our customers experience using our website. Speed and functionality are crucial to our success. To be successful in this role you must be the kind of software engineer who can produce strong front end code; a person who can build great products and provide a great customer experience. We don’t care if you taught yourself, attended a boot camp, or have a Computer Science degree; we care that you know your stuff. This means you have superb software engineering fundamentals, produce thoughtfully designed code that is reliable and maintainable. All of that is meaningless without thorough testing, of course. We’re looking for engineers that are enthusiastic about learning new technologies and skills that will continue to make a difference as Zoro steps the next step forward.

Technologies We Use:
We expect a strong understanding of JavaScript ES5 and ES6 as well as Webpack and Docker. A large chunk of our application is written in Vue so ideally you’re well antiquated with the framework.
As you are developing, testing should be at the forefront of your mind. We use Jasmine to test our JavaScript code.
HTML & CSS are the core building blocks for any front-end developer and it’s no different here. We use templating engines such as Dust.
For our databases, we heavily rely on Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Redis. We have a couple other platforms in use throughout our applications.
Our cloud platform is currently AWS but are transitioning to GCP. It’s important to understand the tools and services offered by a cloud service provider in order to choose the best option for your application.
Git push origin source-control
Are there others? Yes. Is our stack fun? Yes. Will you get to work on what interests you? Yes. Should you apply? Yes.
Requirements:
Degree in Computer Science, a related technical or scientific field, or equivalent experience
2-4 years experience as a software engineer
Familiarity with continuous integration and build tools
Mastery of one programming language and working knowledge of at least one other
Familiarity with multiple frameworks from languages and domains
Understanding of multiple programming paradigms
Good grasp of design patterns and anti-patterns
Final note:

We share a commitment to our Zoro values – Win & Lose Together (We prefer winning!), Take Ownership, We Are Transparent, and Aspire to be Customer-Obsessed.

Broadway is seeking Senior Software Engineers to develop state-of-the-art C++ applications for our groundbreaking automated trading platform. We are a rapidly growing international enterprise software company built and run by engineers. Our technology makes it simple to create, combine, and extend large-scale, high-performance intelligent systems in ways that were never before possible.

Broadway’s solutions are built on the TOC, our core platform for scalable high-performance distributed computing. For over a decade, we’ve been using the TOC to build intelligent trading systems for leading financial institutions. We’re now starting to leverage the same technology to solve real-time problems across every industry.

You will own (typically multiple months-long) development projects end-to-end at the forefront of one of the most exciting areas in fintech, from conception through support and maintenance, including many fast-cycle version iterations. As part of our remarkably high-performing team of collaborative, talented engineers who thrive on building the most advanced technology, you will have significant freedom and self-direction to tackle a wealth of interesting, challenging problems as we push the technological envelope.

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

The Platform

With revolutionary innovations in performance, availability, ease of use and security, we designed OCI for the reliability, predictability and quality that the world’s largest companies and smartest start-ups need. We combined the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure. As a result, our customers can run the most demanding workloads, as well as less compute-intensive applications, in a secure and highly available cloud environment.

The Product

Oracle's Developer Services Group designs, builds and operates Oracle's next-generation public cloud services which enable customers to write cloud-native microservices packaged and deployed as containers, such as Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle Functions, Oracle Container Registry, Oracle API Gateway etc.

We are hiring engineers to work on a new cloud-native service in developer services space.
